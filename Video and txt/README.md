# Nightmare Heart
 4th week of game a week at MMU where the theme is 'nightmare heart'

The Heart Market,

this project was made in collaboration with Tawhidull Sahid

i built the surgery scene and handled the manager to control scene changes and made the music, my partner made the art and used a pathfinding algorithm for the NPCs.

video annotations:
during surgery you can remove any part of the corpse that has been cut out the body with a single click
the overworld scene pauses in the background during surgery
police use basic patrolling and attacking states and get more aggresive the more people you kill
each night has more police and a higher quota than the previous to increase difficulty
